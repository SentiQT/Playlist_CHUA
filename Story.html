<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>I may not live to see our glory<br>
I may not live to see our glory<br>
But I've seen wonders great and small<br>
I've seen wonders great and small<br>
'Cause if the tomcat can get married<br>
If Alexander can get married<br>
There's hope for our ass after all<br>

<p>Raise a glass to freedom (hey!)<br>
Something you will never see again<br>
No matter what she tells you<br>
Let's have another round tonight<br>
Raise a glass to the four of us, oh (hey!)<br>
To the newly not poor of us (whoo-ooh)<br>
We'll tell the story of tonight<br>
Let's have another round<br>

<p>Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr<br>
Sir!<br>
I didn't think that you would make it<br>
To be sure<br>
Burr<br>
I came to say congratulations<br>
Spit a verse, Burr<br>
I see the whole gang is here<br>
You are the worst, Burr<br>

<p>Ignore them, congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel<br>
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal<br>
No, you don't<br>
Yes, I do<br>
Now, be sensible<br>
From what I heard, you've made yourself indispensable<br>

<p>Well, well, I heard you got a special someone on the side, Burr<br>
Is that so?<br>
What are you trying to hide, Burr?<br>
I should go<br>
No, these guys should go<br>
What?<br>
No!<br>
Leave us alone<br>
Man<br>

<p>It's alright, Burr<br>
I wish you brought this girl with you tonight, Burr<br>
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir<br>
What do you mean?<br>
She's married<br>
I see<br>
She's married to a British officer<br>
Oh shit<br>

<p>Congrats again, Alexander<br>
Smile more<br>
I'll see you on the other side of the war<br>
I will never understand you<br>
If you love this woman, go get her<br>
What are you waiting for?<br>
I'll see you on the other side of the war<br>
I'll see you on the other side of the war<br>

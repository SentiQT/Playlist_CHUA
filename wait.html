<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>Theodosia writes me a letter every day<br>
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away<br>
He's on the British side in Georgia<br>
He's trying to keep the colonies inline<br>
But he can keep all of Georgia<br>
Theodosia, she's mine</p>

<p>Love doesn't discriminate<br>
Between the sinners and the saints<br>
It takes and it takes and it takes<br>
And we keep loving anyway<br>
We laugh and we cry and we break<br>And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side<br>
When so many have tried<br>
Then I'm willing to wait for it<br>
I'm willing to wait for it<br></p>

<p>My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher<br>
(Preacher, preacher, preacher)<br>
But there are things that the<br>
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya
(Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya)<br>
My mother was a genius (genius)<br>
My father commanded respect (respect, respect)<br>
When they died they left no instructions<br>
Just a legacy to protect<br></p>

<p>Death doesn't discriminate<br>
Between the sinners and the saints<br>
It takes and it takes and it takes<br>
And we keep living anyway<br>
We rise and we fall and we break<br>
And we make our mistakes<br>
And if there's a reason I'm still alive<br>
When everyone who loves me has died<br>
I'm willing to wait for it (wait for it)<br>
I'm willing to wait for it<br></p>

<p>I am the one thing in life I can control<br>
(Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it)<br>
I am inimitable<br>
I am an original<br></p>

<p>I'm not falling behind or running late<br>
(Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it)<br>
I'm not standing still<br>
I am lying in wait (wait, wait, wait)<br></p>

<p>Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb<br>
(Climb, climb, climb)<br>
He has something to prove<br>
He has nothing to lose<br>
(Lose, lose, lose, lose<br>
Hamilton's pace is relentless<br>
He wastes no time (time, time, time)<br></p>

<p>What is it like in his shoes?<br>
Hamilton doesn't hesitate<br>He exhibits no restraint<br>
He takes and he takes and he takes<br>
And he keeps winning anyway<br>
He changes the game<br>
He plays and he raises the stakes<br>
And if there's a reason<br>
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then goddamnit<br>
I'm willing to wait for it (wait for it)<br>
I'm willing to wait for it<br></p>

<p>Life doesn't discriminate<br>
Between the sinners and the saints<br>
It takes and it takes and it takes<br>
(And we keep living anyway)<br>
We rise and we fall (we rise)<br>
And we fall) and we break and we make our mistakes<br>
And if there's a reason I'm still alive<br>
When so many have died<br>
Then I'm willin' to<br></p>

<p>Wait for it (wait for it, wait for it)<br>
Wait for it (wait for it, wait for it)<br>
(Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it)<br>
(Wait)<br></p>

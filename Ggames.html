<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>Father, God King<br>
Rarely do I ask for favors<br>
Now, I'm knocking on your door<br>
With hopes to save a friendship with one who's a prisoner far from home<br>
Odysseus</p>

<p>Divine intervention, is that what you seek?<br>
To untie apprehensions that were placed on that Greek?<br>
You are playing with thunder for a man full of shame<br>
But if he's worth the risk of going under, why not make it a game?<br>
Convince each of them that he ought to be released, and I'll release him</p>

<p>Who's them?</p>

<p>Apollo, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Ares, Hera, or me<br>
What do you say?</p>

<p>Great<br>
Very well<br>
Eh<br>
Alriht<br>
Groovy<br>
Bring it</p>

<p>Apollo!</p>

<p>You all know I'm a fan of catchy songs<br>
So with so many sirens gone, I think Ody's in the wrong</p>

<p>They were trying to do him worse<br>
All he did was reimburse them<br>
Now they'll tread with caution first<br>
To live another day and sing another verse</p>

<p>If that's true, release him</p>

<p>Hephaestus!</p>

<p>Trust is not given, it's forged<br>
Why should I give him my support?<br>
He sacrificed his own cohort</p>

<p>Did you forget they failed to listen?<br>
He was betrayed and then imprisoned<br>
But if you make the right decision<br>
He can still build a future with those who miss him</p>

<p>Fine, release him</p>

<p>Aphrodite</p>

<p>Your little high and mighty Odysseus<br>
Claims to love his mother<br>
But let her die of a broken heart</p>

<p>He was busy fighting</p>

<p>More like busy spiting the cyclops<br>
Let him feel the pain that his mother felt and rot</p>

<p>Wait, please reconsider this</p>

<p>Really Athena? These old tricks</p>

<p>Ares!</p>

<p>Ares, Ares<br>
What kind of sick coward<br>
Holds back his power<br>
While his friends get devoured?<br>
He didn't even fight Scylla<br>
Didn't even try to kill her<br>
Hides inside a wooden horse to get the job done<br>
Never handles things upfront<br>
Pathetic and weak like his son</p>

<p>Hold your tongue now<br>
His son's my friend<br>
And tell your lover that a broken heart can mend<br>
You want more bloodshed?<br>
Then set him free<br>
To get back to his homestead, he'll make everybody bleed</p>

<p>Ugh, release him</p>

<p>Hey baby</p>

<p>Hera!</p>

<p>So many heroes<br>
So many tales<br>
Give me one good reason why yours should prevail</p>

<p>He's got the mind of a genius</p>

<p>Try harder<br>
He's pretty skilled with words<br>
You can do better than that</p>

<p>He's kind of funny?</p>

<p>Eh</p>

<p>Never once has he cheated on his wife</p>

<p>Release him</p>

<p>I've played your game and won<br>
Release him</p>

<p>You dare to defy me?<br>
To make me feel shame?<br>
No one beats me, no one wins my game!<br>
Thunder, bring her through the wringer<br>
Show her I'm the judgement call<br>
The one who makes her kingdom fall!</p>

<p>Is she dead?</p>

<p>Let him go, please<br>
Let him go</p>

<h2> Lyrics </h2>

<p>Penelope

<p>Is it you? Have my prayers been answered?<br>
Is it really you standing there, or am I dreaming once more?<br>
You look different, your eyes look tired<br>
Your frame is lighter, your smile torn<br>
Is it really you, my love?</p>

<p>I am not the man you fell in love with<br>
I am not the man you once adored<br>
I am not your kind and gentle husband<br>
And I am not the love you knew before</p>

<p>Would you fall in love with me again<br>
If you knew all I've done?<br>
The things I cannot change<br>
Would you love me all the same?<br>
I know that you've been waiting, waiting for love</p>

<p>What kinds of things did you do?</p>

<p>Left a trail of red on every island<br>
As I traded friends like objects I could use<br>
Hurt more lives than I can count on my hands<br>
But all of that was to bring me back to you<br>
So tell me</p>

<p>Would you fall in love with me again<br>
If you knew all I've done?<br>
The things I can't undo<br>
I am not the man you knew<br>
I know that you've been waiting, waiting</p>

<p>If that's true, could you do me a favor?<br>
Just a moment of labor that would bring me some peace<br>
See that wedding bed? Could you carry it over?<br>
Lift it high on your shoulders and take it far away from here</p>

<p>How could you say this?</p>

<p>I had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat<br>
Carved it into the olive tree where we first met<br>
A symbol of our love everlasting<br>
Do you realize what you have asked me?<br>
The only way to move it is to cut it from its roots</p>

<p>Only my husband knew that<br>
So I guess that makes him you<br>
Penelope</p>

<p>I will fall in love with you over and over again<br>
I don't care how, where, or when<br>
No matter how long it's been, you're mine<br>
Don't tell me you're not the same person<br>
You're always my husband, and I've been waiting, waiting<br>
Waiting, waiting<br>
Waiting, oh<br>
For you</p>

<p>How long has it been?<br>
20 years<br>
I, I love you</p>

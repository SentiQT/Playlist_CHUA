<h2> Lyrics </h2>
<p> I saved every letter you wrote me<br>
From the moment I read them, I knew you were mine,<br>
You said you were mine<br>
I thought you were mine</p>

<p>Do you know what Angelica said<br>
When we saw your first letter arrive?<br>
She said, "Be careful with that one, love<br>
He will do what it takes to survive"</p>

<p>You and your words flooded my senses<br>
Your sentences left me defenseless<br>
You built me palaces out of paragraphs<br>
You built cathedrals</p>

<p>I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me<br>
I'm searching and scanning for answers in every line</br>
For some kind of sign</br>
And when you were mine</p>

<p>The world seemed to burn<br>
Burn</p>

<p>You published the letters she wrote you<br>
You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed<br>
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives</p>

<p>Do you know what Angelica said<br>
When she read what you'd done?<br>
She said, "You've married an Icarus<br>
He has flown too close to the sun"</p>

<p>You and your words obsessed with your legacy<br>
Your sentences border on senseless<br>
And you are paranoid in every paragraph<br>
How they perceive you<br>
You, you, you</p>

<p>I'm erasing myself from the narrative<br>
Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted<br>
When you broke her heart<br>
You have torn it all apart</p>

<p>I'm watching it burn<br>
Watching it burn<p>

<p>The world has no right to my heart<br>
The world has no place in our bed<br>
They don't get to know what I said<br>
I'm burning the memories<br>
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you</p>

<p>You forfeit all rights to my heart<br>
You forfeit the place in our bed<br>
You'll sleep in your office instead<br>
With only the memories of when you were mine<br>
I hope that you burn</p>

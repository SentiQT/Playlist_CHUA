<h2>Lyrics</h2>

<p>Captain, I have something that I must confess<br>
Something that I must get off my chest<br>
Until it is said, I cannot rest<br>
(Captain?) Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure<br>
(But captain) there's only so much left we can endure<br>
Whatever you need to say can wait some more<br>
Of that, I'm sure<br>
(Okay)</p>

<p>Eurylochus, back so soon?<br>
Where's the rest of your crew?<br>
And by the gods, what happened to you?</p>

<p>We came across a palace<br>
Inside we heard a voice<br>
It seemed to show no malice<br>
To greet it was our choice<br>
But nothing could prepare us for the power that awaited inside<br>
(What did this palace hide?)</p>

<p>Sir, since we left home, we've faced a variety of foes from a wide range of places<br>
Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist<br>
But this was a hell of a twist, 'cause we are weak to a power like this<br>
(What was it?) A woman<br>
(What?) She had us in just two words</p>

<p>"Come inside" (damn)<br>
Welcome to the best part of your lives<br>
Go ahead and rest wherever you like<br>
I've got you, don't worry, Circe's got you now<br>
(Only I stayed outside, but the rest went in)</p>

<p>Take a seat<br>
Let me bring you all something to eat<br>
I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet<br>
I've got you, don't worry, Circe's got you now<br>
(By the time they ate, it was far too late)</p>

<p>For inside the meal (think of your past)<br>
She had cast a spell (and your mistakes)<br>
They began to squeal (they'll be the last)<br>
And grow snouts and tails (mistakes you'll make)<br>
She changed them<br>
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power<br>
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer<br>
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah</p>

<p>They transformed (this is the price)<br>
And it wasn't quick (we pay to live)<br>
She turned our men (the world does not)<br>
From men to pigs (tend to forgive)<br>
She changed them<br>
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power<br>
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer<br>
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah</p>

<p>no, we don't<br>
Look at all we've lost and all we've learned<br>
Every single cost is so much more than what we've earned<br>
Think about the men we have left before there's none<br>
Let's just cut our losses, you and I, and let's run<br>
Of course, I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run<br>
But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done<br>
There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save<br>
I can only hope you'd do the same</p>

<p>I can hear her still (no one will find)<br>
And her voice deceives (their way between)<br>
What if she can't be killed? (My nymphs and I)<br>
Will you choose to leave? (Their loving queen)<br>
(I don't know)<br>
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power<br>
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer<br>
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah</p>

<p>She's a clever witch (this is the price)<br>
And she's hard to slay (we pay to love)<br>
It's a game of wits (we draw the line)<br>
But you don't have to play (watch from above)<br>
I have to try<br>
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power<br>
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer<br>
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah</p>

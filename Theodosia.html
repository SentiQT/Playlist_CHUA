<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?<br>
You have my eyes, you have your mother's name<br>
When you came into the world, you cried<br>
And it broke my heart</p>

<p>I'm dedicating every day to you<br>
Domestic life was never quite my style<br>
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart<br>
And to thought I was so smart</p>

<p>You will come of age with our young nation<br>
We'll bleed and fight for you<br>
We'll make it right for you<br>
If we lay a strong enough foundation<br>
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you<br>
And you'll blow us all away<br>
Someday, someday<br>
Yeah, you'll blow us all away<br>
Someday, someday</p>

<p>Oh, Philip, when you smile I am undone<br>
My son, look at my son<br>
Pride is not the word I'm looking for<br>
There is so much more inside me now<br>
Oh, Philip, you outshine the morning sun<br>
My son<br>
When you smile, I fall apart<br>
And I thought I was so smart</p>

<p>My father wasn't around (my father wasn't around)<br>
I swear that I'll be around for you<br>
I'll do whatever it takes (I'll make a million mistakes)<br>
I'll make the world safe and sound for you</p>

<p>Will come of age with our young nation<br>
We'll bleed and fight for you<br>
We'll make it right for you<br>
If we lay a strong enough foundation<br>
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you<br>
And you'll blow us all away<br>
Someday, someday<br>
Yeah, you'll blow us all away<br>
Someday, someday</p>

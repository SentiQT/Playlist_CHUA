<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>I'm supposed to choose a suitor to wear the crown<br>
I said I would choose as soon as I weave this shroud<br>
They don't know that every night<br>
I unthread all the work I've done</p>

<p>'Cause I'd rather lie<br>
Than allow them to think they've won<br>
Though I never thought that I'd resort to this<br>
Just know I'll be here</p>

<p>But I don't know how much longer I'll last since we saw that storm<br>
And though it was so close to our kingdom, it was far from the norm, unless<br>
Oh, could it be some kinda sign<br>
That my world is all about to change?<br>
Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?<br>
Though I never thought that it would come to this<br>
Just know I'll be here buying you time</p>

<p>Time is fleeting, it's running out<br>
Time to be the man of the house (oh, buying you time)<br>
Time is fleeting, it's running out<br>
Time to be the man of the house</p>

<p>Whoever can string my husband's old bow<br>
And shoot through 12 axes cleanly<br>
Will be the new king, sit down at the throne<br>
And rule with me as his queen</p>

<p>Let the arrow fly<br>
Once you know that your aim is true<br>
'Cause I'd rather die<br>
Than grow old without the best of you</p>

<p>hough I never thought that these would be the lengths we go for love<br>
I would not have it any other way<br>
And though I never thought that it would end like this<br>
Just know I'll be here<br>
Waiting, waiting<br>
waiting, waiting<br>
(Penelope) waiting, waiting<br>
Oh</p>

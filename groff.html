<h2>Lyrics</h2>

<p>You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay<br>
You cry</p>

<p>In your tea, which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by<br>
Why so sad?<br>
Remember, we made an arrangement when you went away<br>
Now, you're making me mad<br>
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man</p>

<p>You'll be back, soon, you'll see<br>
You'll remember you belong to me<br>
You'll be back, time will tell<br>
You'll remember that I served you well<br>
Oceans rise, empires fall<br>
We have seen each other through it all<br>
And when push comes to shove<br>
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!</p>

<p>Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya</p>

<p>You say our love is draining, and you can't go on<br>
You'll be the one complainin' when I am gone<br>
And no, don't change the subject<br>
'Cause you're my favorite subject<br>
My sweet, submissive subject<br>
My loyal, royal subject<br>
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever</p>

<p>You'll be back like before<br>
I will fight the fight and win the war<br>
For your love, for your praise<br>
And I'll love you 'til my dying days<br>
When you're gone, I'll go mad<br>
So don't throw away this thing we had<br>
'Cause when push comes to shove<br>
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love</p>

<p>Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da, dat- everybody!<br>
Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da<br>
Da-da-da, dat, da-ya-da-ah</p>

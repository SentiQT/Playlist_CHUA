<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>Look around, look around<br>
At how lucky we are to be alive right now<br>
Look around, look around</p>

<p>How long have you known?<br>
A month or so<br>
Eliza, you should have told me<br>
I wrote to the General a month ago (no)<br>
I begged him to send you home<br>
You should have told me<br>
I'm not sorry</p>

<p>I knew you'd fight until the war was won (the war's not done)<br>
But you deserve a chance to meet your son<br>
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now<br>
Will you relish being a poor man's wife<br>
Unable to provide for your life?<br>
I relish being your wife</p>

<p>Look around, look around<br>
Look at where you are<br>
Look at where you started<br>
The fact that you're alive is a miracle<br>
Just stay alive, that would be enough<br>
And if this child shares a fraction of your smile<br>
Or a fragment of your mind<br>
Look out world, that would be enough</p>

<p>I don't pretend to know<br>
The challenges you're facing<br>
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind<br>
But I'm not afraid<br>
I know who I married<br>
So long as you come home at the end of the day<br>
That would be enough</p>

<p>We don't need a legacy<br>
We don't need moneyh<br>
If I could grant you peace of mind<br>
If you could let me inside your heart<br>
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative<br>
In the story they will write someday<br>
Let this moment be the first chapter<br>
Where you decide to stay</p>

<p>And I could be enoughh<br>
And we could be enough<br>
That would be enough</p>
